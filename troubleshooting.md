## Registration

**1.\)I am not sure how to register my GPS maps in my backroadmapbooks.com account?**

To register your maps on our website you will need to create an account or login to your existing account.  
You will need access to the license files located on your microSD inside the Garmin folder.

## Map Setup

**1.\)Maps show up as unauthenticated or locked in basecamp?**

Unauthenticated means the license file has not been imported into Garmin basecamp, you will need to import the .gma file found in your account or on your microSD card's Garmin folder.  
Locked maps mean there is no license file found for the mapset loaded in basecamp, importing your .gma license file will allow you to unlock the maps fully.

**2.\)Garmin Basecamp doesnt show any detail even after unlocking the maps?**

Once the map has been loaded and unlocked in basecamp you will need to adjust the detail level settings.

**Windows**  
In basecamp go to View --&gt; Toolbars and in the fly out window make sure detail level has a checkmark beside it.  
Once detail level is enabled you can see a dropdown menu with detail level settings.  
Choose highest for best results.

**Mac**  
Use the slider on the control panel at the bottom of the basecamp screen.

> **\[info\] Note**  
> You may need to restart basecamp to allow changes to take effect.

**3.\)Mapinstall can't find my SD card or device?**

Mapinstall will not transfer your maps to the card or device unless it has a matching license code.  
If you have an SD card you will need to insert the card directly into your card reader and NOT in the GPS unit.  
If you have the DVD version you will need to make sure your UnitID is correct and the maps have been unlocked correctly.

## GPS Map Troubleshooting

Here are some additional steps to make sure your maps are working correctly:

**1- Does your unit take the big or the small card?**

If it takes the big card, make sure you have inserted the small card in the big card first \(the big card is just an adapter\).  
Restart your unit and see if you see the maps now.

**2- Is your SD card inserted properly?**

SD CARD: Make sure you have pushed it firmly in the slot.  
Micro-SD Card: Align the notch on the chip with the notch in the bay. Flip the cage down and slide it towards you to lock.  
Restart your unit and see if you see the maps now.

**3- What scale are you currently zoomed to?**

Zoom in and see if you see the black symbols. If you see the black symbols you are seeing our maps.

**4- Is the unit reading the SD card?**

Go to Map Setup&gt;Map Information and confirm that our maps are being read by the unit and that they are enabled.  
Different GPS units will have different settings so you may need to consult the manual to find the correct option to view the installed maps.

**5- Did you send "anything" \(like way points or tracks\) to your SD card?**

If you did, you might have overwritten the card with "no maps", by having the "maps" box selected in MapSource/BaseCamp. No fear, if you have your SD card registered, you can rebuild the card.

> **\[info\] Note**  
> If your unit is not recognizing the SD card still do the following:

1- Soft boot: Remove SD &gt; Replace Batteries &gt; Hold for 5 secs to Power Off &gt; Power Back Up Fully &gt; Power Back Down &gt; Insert SD &gt; Replace Batteries &gt; Power Back Up

2- Firmware Update: Google "Garmin Express" and install the freshest Firmware for your Unit. Firmware is what makes the Unit work. So it is important to have the latest software for your unit at all times. Make sure you take the SD card out of your unit before updating your GPS device.

3- Overwritten SD Card: Did you send anything to your unit? if yes you might have overwritten the SD Card with NO Maps. Confirm by checking the size of the gmapsupp.img file on your Unit.

4- Defective Adapter: If your Unit requires the bigger card and if you have a faulty adapter, the SD Card won't be read by the unit. Try a different Adapter if one is handy. Otherwise purchase a new one at any Superstore, Walmart, Futureshop, Best Buy.

## Rebuilding your MicroSD card

> **\[info\] Note**  
> If your Maps have become corrupted or accidentally deleted from the card you can rebuild the map data. SD Card must be registered in your account.

If you are transferring the maps to the SD card, you MUST insert the microSD card into the SD card adapter and then insert the adapter into your computer's SD card slot. If you do not have a microSD slot on your computer you may have to send us your card to have it recoded.

1.\) Open Garmin MapInstall  
2.\) Select the SD card or GPS unit from the Device drop down box and click the Continue button

![](/assets/mapinstall_device.png)

3.\) Find the drop down box at the bottom of the window.  If not already selected, select the updated version listing for the desired Province / Region.

4.\) Select the map tiles that you wish to transfer.

If you want to select the entire province / region, you can do so by clicking and dragging from above and to the left of the top corner to below and to the right of the bottom right corner.

Zoom out, if necessary, to see the whole province / region.  Once you've selected the desired map tiles, click the Send Maps button.

> \*\*\[info\] Note\*\*  
> &gt;You may get a warning message about overwriting data on a pre-programmed card,This is a standard warning and is notifying you that a file called gmapsupp.img will be created and copied to the SD card.

6.\)When the transfer is complete you will have a new map image file called "gmapsupp.img"

7.\)Download the new .gma file you generated from your account.

**\(We recommend using Firefox or Chrome to download the .gma file\).**

8.\)Copy the .gma file into the Garmin folder.

9.\)Copy the 25 digit code from your user account and paste it into a text file, save the file as gmapsupp.unl and **make sure there is no .txt extension.**

10.\)Copy the gmapsupp.unl file into the garmin folder.

11.\)Your card should now have the updated map data and license file.

> **\[info\] Note**  
> On a mac when you delete the existing .img file you will need to empty the trash to free up the space on the card or it will complain about not enough space.

## Transfer POI file

> **\[info\] Note**  
> When you download the computer map .zip archive it will also contain your new .gpi file for POI's

1.\)On your SD Card navigate to the Garmin folder.

2.\)Copy the .gpi file into the POI folder on the SD card.

3.\)You can delete the old .gpi file.

The Garmin folder should look similar to the following image
