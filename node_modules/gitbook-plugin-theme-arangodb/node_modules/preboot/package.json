  "readme": "# [Preboot 2](http://getpreboot.com)\r\n\r\nPreboot is a collection of LESS mixins and variables for quickly writing CSS. As the precursor to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), it serves as a lightweight and interface agnostic approach to jumpstarting your next web project. Use it how you see fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nPreboot requires [LESS](http://lesscss.org). Head over to their documentation and familiarize yourself with the project. Once you're up and running, including and using Preboot is a breeze.\r\n\r\n1. Create a new LESS file (e.g., application.less)\r\n2. Include Preboot via `@import \"preboot.less\";`\r\n3. Start writing your own LESS-flavored CSS\r\n\r\nWe highly recommend using Preboot in conjunction with [Normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css), a powerful tool for more consistent rendering of web components across various browsers and devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs and feature requests\r\n\r\nHave a bug or a feature request? [Please open a new issue](https://github.com/mdo/preboot/issues). Before opening any issue, please search for existing issues and read the [Issue Guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines), written by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n**Mark Otto**\r\n\r\n+ [http://twitter.com/mdo](http://twitter.com/mdo)\r\n+ [http://github.com/mdo](http://github.com/mdo)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief history\r\n\r\nPreboot was originally released in March 2011 under the name Bootstrap.less. Sensing the need for a larger and more comprehensive framework, I copped the name and created Bootstrap based on the original variables and mixins work here. To avoid obivous naming issues, I renamed this Preboot and essentially didn't touch the project for two years.\r\n\r\nFast forward two years and I'm backporting many of Bootstrap's variables and mixins back into Preboot as v2.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Preboot v1 (Bootstrap.less) was released under a Creative Commons license and is still available. Preboot 2 is now under MIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright and license\r\n\r\n[MIT](LICENSE.md)\r\n",
